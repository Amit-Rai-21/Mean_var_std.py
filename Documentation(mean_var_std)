Documentation for Matrix Calculation Code

Here is a piece of Python code where you can enter a 3 × 3 matrix, and it calculates some statistical properties of the matrix. Here is a breakdown of how the code works, and a brief explanation of what the code does.

Overview:
The code performs the following steps:

Input the Matrix: The user is prompted to input 9 integers (for a 3x3 matrix).
Matrix Validation: It ensures that the input contains exactly 9 numbers.
Matrix Operations: Once validated, the matrix is reshaped into a 3x3 array, and several calculations are performed on it, including:
1.Mean
2.Variance
3.Standard Deviation
4.Maximum value
5.Minimum value
7.Sum

Detailed Explanation:
Input Data:
The user is prompted to enter 9 integers separated by spaces. These integers are then converted into a list of integers using map(int, input().split()).
This list is validated to ensure that it contains exactly 9 elements. If not, an error message is shown.

Matrix Reshaping:
The input data is reshaped into a 3x3 matrix using np.array(Data).reshape(rows, cols). This is done using NumPy, a powerful library for numerical operations in Python.


Matrix Calculations:

Mean: The mean is calculated across each column (axis=0), each row (axis=1), and the entire matrix.
Variance: Variance is calculated similarly to the mean but measures the spread of data points around the mean.

Standard Deviation: This is the square root of the variance and measures the dispersion of data.

Max: The maximum value is calculated across each row, each column, and the entire matrix.

Min: The minimum value is calculated in the same way as the maximum.

Sum: The sum of the elements is calculated across each row, each column, and the entire matrix.

Output:
The results for each of the above operations are stored in a dictionary (Calculatons) and printed to the console.
